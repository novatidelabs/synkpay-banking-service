## üîó Inter-Service Communication

The Banking Service communicates with:

- Auth Service ‚Üí to validate user identity and permissions

- SDK.finance ‚Üí for banking & ledger operations

- API Gateway ‚Üí as the exclusive entry point for clients

All requests include correlation IDs for observability.

## Internal Service Security
This microservice is secured by an internal authentication mechanism. It should not be exposed directly to external clients, as it's designed to be accessed exclusively by authorized internal services.

All incoming requests are validated by the InternalAuthMiddleware, which checks for a unique shared secret within the x-internal-auth header.

### How to Use It

- API Gateway: Our API Gateway is the only service with permission to access this microservice. It must be configured to include a header named x-internal-auth with the correct secret value in every request it forwards.

- Environment Variables: The secret key is stored as an environment variable to prevent it from being hardcoded. Make sure the following variable is defined in the service's .env file or configuration:

```env
INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET_BANKING_SERVICE=your_unique_and_secure_secret_key
```

- For Development: When testing locally, you can use tools like Postman or Insomnia to manually add the x-internal-auth header to your requests.

- Not exposed directly to clients ‚Äî always behind API Gateway

- All communication secured via JWT validation through Auth Service
